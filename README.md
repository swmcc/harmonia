## Description

Harmonia is a feminine name with Greek and Latin roots that truly speaks—and
sings—for itself. Similar to the name Harmony, this name translates to
*“unity”* and *“concord”* always reminding your bundle of joy to search for
peace in any situation.

## Introduction

Welcome to Harmonia, the new and emerging IRC bot designed to serve and
entertain the legendary `#cabal` chatroom. Harmonia is the successor to
Discordia, the once-revered bot that frequented the fabled realms of the
`#cabal`.

## The Legend of Discordia

Discordia was not just a bot; she was a legend. Acting as the official
gatekeeper for `#cabal`, which has been an active chatroom since April 2001,
Discordia held many secrets and mysteries. One day, she mysteriously vanished.
Legend has it that she still exists, hidden away in some long-forgotten repo
held in subversion, somewhere on some forgotten server. However, her exact
resting place has been lost to history.

## Meet Harmonia

As the new bot for `#cabal`, Harmonia is starting off small. Over time, with
contributions from the cabal nerds, she aims to grow and evolve. Who knows?
Maybe she will become what
[V'ger](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/V%27ger) became, a reflection of
collective curiosity and exploration.

## Reality Check

In reality, this is just a fun project intended to bring together the community
around `#cabal`. The hope is that, as time moves on, other members will
contribute to making Harmonia as legendary as her predecessor.

## Contributing

If you're a member of the `#cabal` and have ideas, secrets, or features you'd
like to add to Harmonia, feel free to contribute to this repository. Together,
we can write the next chapter in the rich history of #cabal.

The happy serving bot for the `#cabal` nerds.
